# Secure-Web-App-Dev-Assignment_Project
Secure Web Application Development Assignment Project (PHP, HTML5, CSS3, MySQL, SOAP, Twig & Slim) - First | 71% 

The project was completed working within a team of three over the course of two months. 

Information is retrieved via an EE SMS service using SOAP, it is then parsed, validated and stored into the database. This information is then shown on screen to the user, we used Twig, SLim and HTML to display the data on screen to the user.

Note: My work predominantly focused on the HTML, CSS, Twig and Slim parts of the project. Although I did in some instances aid another team member in setting up the PHP side of the application. In order for better understanding of how the system works I elected to show the entire project than solely my work alone.
